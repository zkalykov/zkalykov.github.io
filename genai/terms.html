                <p class="mb-4">

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Business Uses of Our Services</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these Terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify GenAI and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit, or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these Terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and attorneys' fees.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About These Terms</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We may modify these Terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will post notice of modifications to these Terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If there is a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    These Terms control the relationship between GenAI and you. They do not create any third-party beneficiary rights.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If any term is unenforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The laws of Texas, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.
